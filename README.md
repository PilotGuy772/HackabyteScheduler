# **ScheduleCraft**

## Inspiration
The idea of the hackathon was based on student issues. This would help students.
Our original idea was to help schedule days for student athletes and incorporate rest time into our schedule. But we broadened it to help students work with their assignments and unique schedules. 
## What it does
It schedules assignments based on time and priority.
## How we built it
We built it in c# and we currently have a TUI app. This interactive app helps users accurately 
## Challenges we ran into
Vishnu had to teach himself C# along the way as he did not know C# prior to starting the project.
Data entry was hard to implement in a user friendly fashion.
## Accomplishments that we're proud of
We created a project that works decently in a short amount of time with an original idea (that morphed over time)
## What we learned
We learned a lot of new programming concepts and best practices. This was our first time in a hackathon so we were able to learn a lot about how it worked and what to do.
## What's next for ScheduleCraft
We might expand on the idea if it gains traction with the local student community.
